High-Risk Jobs — Repetitive & Scripted

These roles are most exposed because AI can now follow rules, process data, and respond to predictable situations:

Data Entry & Admin Support — OCR + automation makes manual input unnecessary

Basic Bookkeeping & Payroll — AI handles reconciliation & reporting cheaply and accurately

Scripted Customer Support — Level-1 chat & voice support is now AI-driven

Junior Content Creation — Routine copy and captions are mostly automated

Low-Risk Jobs — Human Skill Matters

These roles thrive because they require judgment, empathy, or hands-on work AI can’t replicate:

Skilled Trades — Plumbers, electricians, HVAC: every job is unique and physical

Healthcare Professionals — Patients still value human trust & care

Strategic & Ethical Roles — Leaders, HR, legal advisors handle grey-area decisions

Human-Centered Work — Teachers, psychologists, social workers rely on emotional connection

Quick Risk Index
Sector	Risk Level	Why
BPO / Call Centers	Critical	Scripted, repetitive workflows
Entry-Level Finance	High	AI processes numbers faster & cheaper
Construction / Trades	Low	Physical dexterity & adaptability needed
Creative Strategy	Low	Humans still drive originality
Education	Low	Focus on mentorship & motivation

Bottom line:
If a job follows a script, AI can likely do it.
If it requires empathy, creativity, or hands-on problem-solving, humans remain essential.
