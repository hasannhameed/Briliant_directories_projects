  <p><strong>How much does a gay massage cost in New York City?</strong></p>
  <p>Most licensed male massage therapists in NYC charge around $120–$180 per hour for in-studio sessions. Outcalls or premium treatments (90-minute, couples, or four-handed massages) typically range from $160–$250.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Do therapists travel to my home or hotel?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes. Many New York practitioners offer private in-home and hotel outcalls across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as select areas in Jersey City and the Bronx.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Can I book same-day?</strong></p>
  <p>Usually. NYC has high availability for same-day appointments, but evenings and weekends in Midtown, Chelsea, and Hell’s Kitchen tend to book up quickly—so scheduling ahead is recommended.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Which massage styles are most popular?</strong></p>
  <p>Deep Tissue, Swedish, Sports, and Thai are among the most requested in New York. Some therapists also specialize in Tantra, Reiki, or energy-based sessions for holistic balance and connection.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Are all sessions strictly therapeutic, or do they vary by practitioner?</strong></p>
  <p>Each practitioner defines their own approach and boundaries. Profiles clearly outline techniques and session focus—from restorative and athletic bodywork to more meditative or energy-focused experiences. Read each profile carefully and communicate openly about your expectations.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>How do I find a therapist near me?</strong></p>
  <p>Use filters for neighborhood (Chelsea, Midtown, Williamsburg, Harlem, Astoria, etc.), schedule, and in-studio vs. outcall to locate your ideal therapist.</p>
