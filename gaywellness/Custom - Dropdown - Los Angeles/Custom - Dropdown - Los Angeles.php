  <p><strong>How much does a gay massage cost in Los Angeles?</strong></p>
  <p>Most licensed male therapists charge about $120–$160 per hour for in-studio sessions. Outcalls or specialty sessions (90-min, couples, four-handed) often run $160–$250.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Do therapists travel to my home or hotel?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes. Many LA providers offer discreet in-home and hotel outcalls across West Hollywood, Hollywood, DTLA, the Valley, and beach cities.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Can I book same-day?</strong></p>

  <p>Deep Tissue, Thai, Sports, and Swedish lead the way. Some providers also offer Reiki, couples, or four-handed sessions.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Are all sessions strictly therapeutic or do they vary by practitioner?</strong></p>
  <p>Each practitioner defines their own service boundaries. Profiles clearly describe techniques and session focus—from relaxation and sports recovery to energy or bodywork. Always review a provider’s description and communicate your expectations before booking.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>How do I find a therapist near me?</strong></p>
  <p>Use filters for neighborhood (West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Long Beach, Sherman Oaks, etc.), schedule, and outcall vs. studio to find the best match.</p>
  <br>
