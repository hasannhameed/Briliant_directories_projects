Javascript
Deliverables:

Create a function called "writeLetter" which prints "Wrote Letter" after 2 seconds.
Create a function called "postLetter" which prints "Letter Posted" after 1 seconds.
Make sure that "Letter Posted" is printed after "Wrote Letter" because obviously you will post letter only after you write it.
